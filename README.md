This repository contains my submission for the second coursework assignment for the Practical Optimisation course at Cambridge (4M17). This involved using two methods to find the global minima of the 5D eggholder function. I chose to use a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. My code for each method is given in the GenAl.py and SimAn.py files respectively. The two pdf files give the assignment instructions and my submitted report.

For this assignment I was awarded an A (65%-75%).
